During the analysis of 7,000+ customers, the model discovered:
1.  **Fiber Optic Risk:** Customers with Fiber Optic internet are the highest churn risk (likely due to price/service mismatch).
2.  **Contract Sensitivity:** "Month-to-month" contracts are the #1 predictor of churn.
3.  **Tenure Factor:** Churn probability drops significantly after 24 months of tenure.
